                    <li>At 90.14%, Kuwait has near-universal awareness of Abu Dhabi, indicating market saturation for basic awareness.</li>
                    <li>The +3.84pp year-over-year growth suggests continued strong improvement despite already high levels.</li>
                    <li>Marketing focus should shift from basic awareness to differentiation and consideration, as nearly everyone already knows about the destination.</li>
                    <li>Budget allocation should prioritize conversion rather than awareness-building campaigns.</li>

                    <li>Doubling media spend will not double travel queries, and will produce only modest growth.</li>

                    <li><strong>Already Visited (29%, 0pp)</strong>: The stability suggests a consistent proportion of the market has visited before. Repeat visitation strategies highlighting new attractions and experiences should be developed.</li>

                <p>Develop a "Yas Island Family Escape" package in partnership with top-viewed Yas Island properties (particularly the W Abu Dhabi and Hilton properties) that includes accommodation, theme park access, and shopping vouchers. This would align with the demonstrated preferences for Yas Island properties, entertainment attractions, and shopping experiences. Consider timing these packages to coincide with the July-August peak travel period, with promotional campaigns launching in May-June to align with the 27-day booking window.</p>
